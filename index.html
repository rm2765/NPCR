      <div class="tab-pane fade in active" id="tab1default"> <h4> The NYU Urban Planning Capstone team has worked on evaluating the Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA) Program. </h4> The team has surveyed BOA communities, built a tax-value regression model, conducted in-depth interviews with three BOA communities to serve as case studies, and ran demographic analysis of all BOA communities. 
      <br> <br>
      As part of the evaluation, the map below shows where the BOAs are and their relation to sites that are in remediation programs such as the Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP), Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP), and Environmental Restoration Program, and Resource Conversation and Recovery. 
      </div>

      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab2default"> <h4> Brownfield Opportunities Area Program </h4> The BOA program provides local municipalities and community-based organizations resources to engage community stakeholders in visioning the reuse of brownfields in order to spur redevelopment and attract public and private investment to their neighborhoods. The BOA program is a neighborhood-area planning versus unlike the other Brownfield programs which are focused solely on remediation of specfic sites.
      <br><br>
      Eligible participants of the program are towns, municipalities, community-based organizations, and community boards of distressed, blighted communities and/or communities affected by brownfields. Participants are awarded technical and financial assistance up to 90% of total project costs.
      <br><br>
      The BOA program allows communities to get brownfields shovel ready, to create or strenghten partnerships with various stakeholders such as property owners, businesses, developers and local and state agencies, to leverage their BOA work to receive other state or local funding, and BOA sites can recieve a two percent tax credit bonus if its part of the Brownfield Cleanup Program. 
      <br><br>
      Currently, there are 120 BOA communities. The map below shows the boundaries of 107 of them. The BOA areas are highlighted in green. When clicking on a BOA, the infowindow gives you the BOA's name, size in acres, whether the BOA has been designated or not, and the number of brownfield sites that are in a remedial program found within the BOA.
      </div>

      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab3default"> <h4> EnZones </h4> The New York State Department of Labor created New York State Environmental Zones, known as EnZones, which are census tracts that have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent and an unemployment rate of at least 125 percent of the New York State unemployment rate, or a poverty rate of at least double the rate for the county in which the tract is located. The most recent American Community Survey 2010-2014 5-year estimates were used.
      <br><br>
      The BOA program doesn't have requirements like EnZones, but BOA communities tend to be low-income communities and communities of color  who live in blighted and economically distressed areas. Therefore, EnZones and BOA communities overlap; 77% (82 of 107) BOA communities are within EnZones. 
      <br><br>
      Not only can brownfield properties that are within an EnZone be eligble for Brownfield Cleanup Program tax credits <a href="http://esd.ny.gov/businessprograms/Data/BrownfieldCleanup/NYSTaxCreditsFactSheet-BrownfieldCleanupProgram.pdf">(fact sheet)</a> but also can recieve additional credits if redevelopment of their site is in conformance with a BOA plan. 
      <br><br>
     Structuring the different brownfield programs to work with one another, as is the case of the tax credits, will make redevelopment easier for property owners and developers. Getting their interest in brownfield redevelopment is critical for BOA communities to move on from the planning phase to actual development.

      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab4default"> <h4>Environmental Remediation Programs </h4>
      <br>

      <h4> Brownfield Cleanup Program <a href="http://esd.ny.gov/businessprograms/brownfieldcleanup.html">(BCP) </a> </h4>
      The BCP program encourages the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield properties by granting property owners and developers liability relief and tax credits. <br> <br>There are 752 properities that are currently in the BCP program. 
      <br> <br>
      <h4> Voluntary Cleanup Program <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8442.html">(VCP)</a></h4>
      The Voluntary Cleanup Program promotes the private sector cleanup of brownfields. Voluntarily, a property owner, or other private sector individuals seeking to redevelop brownfields, agrees to remediate a brownfield site to the required levels set by the State, pays for oversight costs, and is granted a release from liability when the remediation is complete. <br> <br> There are 482 properties that are currently in the VCP program.

      <br> <br>
      <h4> Environmental Restoration Program <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8444.html">(ERP)</a></h4>
      The Environmental Restoration Program grants eligible municipalities (including towns, villages, school districts, and Indian nations) reimbursement of site investigation and remediation costs, liability protection for claims made against participants and future owners. 
      <br> <br>
      There are 241 properties that are currently in the ERP program. 
      <br> <br>

      <h4> Resource Conversation and Recovery <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8794.html">(RCRA-C)</a></h4>
      Partnership with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act hazardous waste management program has prevented the creation of new Superfund sites, cleaned up contaminated sites, and upgraded or closed poorly-designed facilities that discharged hazardous contaminants. If on properties, waste materials a improperly discharged, stored or treated, the State can subject <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8794.html"> Corrective Action</a> requirements. <br> <br>
      There are 130 properties that are currently in the RCRA-C program. 
      </div>

      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab5default"> <h4> Regional Economic Development Councils <a href="http://regionalcouncils.ny.gov/"> (REDCs)</a>  </h4>
      There are ten Regional Councils in New York State: New York City, Long Island, Southern Tier, Mid-Hudson, Western New York, Finger Lakes, Central New York, Mohawk Valley, Capital Region and North Country. Each of the councils develop their own long term plans to promote economic growth in thier regions. <br><br> There is opportunity for REDCs to work with brownfield programs like the BOA program. Like the combining of tax credit bonuses from the different brownfield programs, REDCs can further aid BOA communities move from the planning phase to development.
